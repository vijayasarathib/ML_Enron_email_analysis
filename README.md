Project Overview

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread
corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information 
entered into public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. 

In this project, i tried to explore the data and see if we can predict any fraud using the emails sent across POI(Person of interest)
to non - POI's. 

I have used the python program and machine learning algorithams to run this analysis.
